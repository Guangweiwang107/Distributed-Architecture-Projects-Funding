# Distributed-Architecture-Projects-Funding
Contains multiple subprojects. The financing project built by springCloud and springBoot, I have completed the whole project framework and basically finished the background management system, but the front-end interaction has not been done yet

It is best to run using eclipse, first use Tomcat to run atcrowdfunding02 - admin - webui, then use the SpringBoot to run atcrowdfunding08, atcrowdfunding10, atcrowdfunding11, atcrowdfunding12, atcrowdfunding16, front-end interactive page address for http://localhost:4000, background management panel at http://localhost:8080/atcrowdfunding02-admin-webui/admin/to/login/page.html
